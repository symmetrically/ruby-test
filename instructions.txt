# Consider the following array :
# ['leopard', 'bear', 'fox', 'wolf']
# In this challenge, your task is to implement method that takes an  array and a skip integer and returns an array of all elements except
# first skip number of items as shown in the example below.


# > skip([‘leopard', 'bear', 'fox', 'wolf'], 2)
# => ["2:fox", "3:wolf"]


# In this challenge, your task is to group the students into two categories corresponding to their marks obtained in a test. The list of students will be provided  
# In a marks hash with student name as key and marks obtained (out of 100) as value pair, along with the pass_marks as argument.
# The method group_by_marks must return a Hash containing an array of students who passed as value to Passed key, and those who failed as value 
# to Failed key. If a particular key is empty, don't return that key.
# For example,

# > marks = {“A”:23, “B”:40, “C”:88, “D”:60}
# > group_by_marks(marks, 30)
# => {"Failed"=>[[“A”, 23]], "Passed"=>[[“B”, 40], [“C”, 88], [“D”, 60]]}
